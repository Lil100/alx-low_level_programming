This project contains a README file, a main.h file (That contain the prototypes) and 8 more files that contain the individual oding to answer the following questions:
Task 0: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
Task 1:Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
Task 2:Write a function that returns the length of a string.
Task 3:Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
Task 4:Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
Task 5:Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
Task 6:Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
Task 7:Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
Task 8:Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
